    > An easier way (in my opinion) to make a poor-mans-random-generator is to look at the current time when the program starts. This example find the current time, expresses it as a duration since 1970, and then extracts the number of nanoseconds elapsed in the current second:
    > So if the current time is 10:20:30.123456789, the "random" number will be 123456789. The number will always be between zero and 1 billion.
